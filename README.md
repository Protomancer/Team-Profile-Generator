# Team Profile Generator

## Description

    This is a command line application that helps you create a siple html webpage using inquirer.I built this app twice as the fist time I didn't fully understand the assignment. This version is significantly better and most of the issues I ran into were due to the inquirer version.

## Installation

    To install this app go to https://github.com/Protomancer/Team-Profile-Generator and copy the code link into your terminal. Go ahead and download it into your area of choice.

## Usage

    To use the app simply open the file in vscode or cd into it in your terminal of choice. Once inside you can run the terminal command node index.js . Once you run the index.js file you will be greeted with a series of questions. Answer the questions to the best of your ability, if the answers you give are not compatible the terminal will display an error. Once you make it through the questions the app will generate a generic html file in the dist folder. From here you can run the index.html in your browser and you will see the employee cards all laid out.
